# HW Be Careful

## Rule
- The folder name should be HW{num}_{student_id}.It must be compressed into a zip file (e.g., HW4_113356048.zip).
- When submitting, include all .java files.
- A Main.java file must be included.
- **The output format must match the example exactly**.
- When there is a formatting error, there is no room for argument.

## Deadline
Each assignment allows two submission attempts. Questions and testing are permitted during TA sessions that fall within the submission period. After the second submission deadline, no additional requests will be processed.


## Bonus
- Please rename your file to HW{num}_{student_id}_bonus. e.g.HW4_113356048_bonus
- Include a bonux.txt file stating what you did and on which line in each file.
- (Optional) You may also add comments in the code.
- example: bonus.txt
  - Student Name/ID : 王方方/113356048
  - Bonus1 : 新增exception catch
    Location : KeywordList Line8~12
  - Bonus2 : {what you do}
    Location : {which file} {which line}
