# HW2 - Generic Geometric Progression
- Output two different types of geometric progressions using inheritance and generics.
    - type 0 : The Growth Population
        - Get initial population and years from user inputs (Use Scanner class)
        - Every 30 years (a generation), the population becomes double
        - Output the Population Progression (by generation)
            E.g.,   Input: 3 people and 120 years.
                    Output: 3, 6, 12, 24, 48
    - type 1 : The Growth of Capital
        - Get initial capital and years from user inputs
        - The annual interest rate is 2% 
        - Output the yearly Capital progression
        - E.g.,     Input: 100 and 2 years.
                    Output: 100, 102, 104.04
- Try to throw/catch exceptions.
